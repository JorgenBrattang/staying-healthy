The developer ran into few problems along the way of developing the website, the problems worth mentioning are the responsive side of the website. 

Bug found when resizing the size of the screens height. It made the footer float far above the bottom of the page.
- <strong style="color:#71F57E;">Problem solved</strong>, by changing the footer from the section to its own place within the HTML and adding a display flex and column to the body.

    - "Issue I found was on the form validation page. The text is hidden by the google maps location on my screen.
        - <strong style="color:#71F57E;">Problem solved</strong>, by changing the div containing the map to auto instead of procent and make the map fixed height.

### <u>Websites on different browsers and screen sizes</u>
The Website it self looks almost the same on different browsers, it changes by it self when reforming the screen size either on the computer or different devices. Small changes have been made to accompany the different sizes. The major part of the website is similar so even if your on a different device you can easly navigate and read the websites content.
