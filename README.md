### Changes during the design process

- <strong>The anatomy</strong> page changed from having a image that displayed the human anatomy to a video that showed you and talked you through the whole process instead.
- <strong>The contact</strong> page changed some text for requirements when filling out the form and the buttons change to a more appealing user experiance.

### <u>Typography</u>
To make the text more easy to read I ended up using [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?thickness=5&preview.text=You%20may%20think%20of%20stretching%20as%20something%20performed%20only%20by%20runners%20or%20gymnasts.%20But%20we%20all%20need%20to%20stretch%20in%20order%20to%20protect%20our%20mobility%20and%20independence.%20%22A%20lot%20of%20people%20don%27t%20understand%20that%20stretching%20has%20to%20happen%20on%20a%20regular%20basis.%20It%20should%20be%20daily,%22%20says%20David%20Nolan,%20a%20physical%20therapist%20at%20Harvard-affiliated%20Massachusetts%20General%20Hospital.&preview.size=17&preview.text_type=custom&query=Poppins)
 for the paragraphs and 
and [Oswald](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oswald?thickness=5&preview.text=You%20may%20think%20of%20stretching%20as%20something%20performed%20only%20by%20runners%20or%20gymnasts.%20But%20we%20all%20need%20to%20stretch%20in%20order%20to%20protect%20our%20mobility%20and%20independence.%20%22A%20lot%20of%20people%20don%27t%20understand%20that%20stretching%20has%20to%20happen%20on%20a%20regular%20basis.%20It%20should%20be%20daily,%22%20says%20David%20Nolan,%20a%20physical%20therapist%20at%20Harvard-affiliated%20Massachusetts%20General%20Hospital.&preview.size=17&preview.text_type=custom&query=oswald)
 for header, and Sans-Serif as backup incase the other fonts don't work.

## <u>Testing</u>
The developer ran into few problems along the way of developing the website, the problems worth mentioning are the responsive side of the website. 

Bug found when resizing the size of the screens height. It made the footer float far above the bottom of the page.
- <strong style="color:#71F57E;">Problem solved</strong>, by changing the footer from the section to its own place within the HTML and adding a display flex and column to the body.

### Slack #peer-code-review
- Carina Stenger
    - "After submitting the form the line ‚have a nice day‘ could use a bit more padding (checked on an iphone SE)"
        - <strong style="color:#71F57E;">Problem solved</strong>, by changing the media queiry for that size of phone.

- Hannah Carey_5p
    - "Issue I found was on the form validation page. The text is hidden by the google maps location on my screen.
        - <strong style="color:#71F57E;">Problem solved</strong>, by changing the div containing the map to auto instead of procent and make the map fixed height.

### <u>Websites on different browsers and screen sizes</u>
The Website it self looks almost the same on different browsers, it changes by it self when reforming the screen size either on the computer or different devices. Small changes have been made to accompany the different sizes. The major part of the website is similar so even if your on a different device you can easly navigate and read the websites content.

## <u>Validator Testing</u>
Ran through all the code and no errors were found.

**HTML**
- No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

**CSS**
- No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

## <u>Unfixed bugs</u>
The developer have no unfixed bugs by the time this was written.

Shortcomings of the technologies used is most noticed in the form when pressing "Submit" and the fade effects on the images/map/video, it could be made smoother and better with use of technologies like for example JAVA.

She also showed me another student README.md for this project, <a href="https://github.com/Irishbecky91/survival-guild" title="Link to Irishbecky91 repository" rel="nofollow">Irishbecky91</a> that I took inspiration from. Irishbecky91 had such good structure that gave my README an awesome baseline to use and continue to grow from for my future projects.
