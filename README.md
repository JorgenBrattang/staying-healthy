### Typography
To make the text more easy to read I ended up using [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?thickness=5&preview.text=You%20may%20think%20of%20stretching%20as%20something%20performed%20only%20by%20runners%20or%20gymnasts.%20But%20we%20all%20need%20to%20stretch%20in%20order%20to%20protect%20our%20mobility%20and%20independence.%20%22A%20lot%20of%20people%20don%27t%20understand%20that%20stretching%20has%20to%20happen%20on%20a%20regular%20basis.%20It%20should%20be%20daily,%22%20says%20David%20Nolan,%20a%20physical%20therapist%20at%20Harvard-affiliated%20Massachusetts%20General%20Hospital.&preview.size=17&preview.text_type=custom&query=Poppins)
 for the paragraphs and 
and [Oswald](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oswald?thickness=5&preview.text=You%20may%20think%20of%20stretching%20as%20something%20performed%20only%20by%20runners%20or%20gymnasts.%20But%20we%20all%20need%20to%20stretch%20in%20order%20to%20protect%20our%20mobility%20and%20independence.%20%22A%20lot%20of%20people%20don%27t%20understand%20that%20stretching%20has%20to%20happen%20on%20a%20regular%20basis.%20It%20should%20be%20daily,%22%20says%20David%20Nolan,%20a%20physical%20therapist%20at%20Harvard-affiliated%20Massachusetts%20General%20Hospital.&preview.size=17&preview.text_type=custom&query=oswald)

<u>This text will be removed, its just a guideline!</u>
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
```

## Validator Testing
Ran through all the code and no errors were found.

**HTML**
- No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

**CSS**
- No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

## Unfixed bugs
```
<u>This text will be removed, its just a guideline!</u>
You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

From my mentor <a href="https://github.com/seunkoko" title="Link to GitHub profile" rel="nofollow">Oluwaseun Owonikoko</a> advice and guidance, she shared her knowledge and gave me insight and ideas to get the most of my website. She also showed me another student README.md for this project, <a href="https://github.com/Irishbecky91/survival-guild" title="Link to Irishbecky91 repository" rel="nofollow">Irishbecky91</a> that I took inspiration from. Irishbecky91 had such good structure that gave my README an awesome baseline to use and continue to grow from for my future projects.
